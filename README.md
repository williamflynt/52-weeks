# 52-weeks
A catalog for once-weekly, outcome oriented activities, starting from 20 June, 2022.

## What & Why

I started this personal, not-tech-specific project as an antidote to "spinning wheels with no traction."

In fact, I think there IS traction, but it's hard to look back and see anything except the big progress we make. Here's an effort to do really small things every week and record them.
Let's celebrate our little progress. 

## Guidelines

1. Do things that are self enriching.
2. Make it an item that isn't already required by life.
3. Goldilocks time box: try for 3-8 hours total.

#### Examples

This week, I want to...

1. Run 6 miles.
2. Complete a big shelving project.
3. Read a book I've been meaning to get to.
4. Fully complete a small code project.
5. Hike a specific trail.

## Weeks in Review

I'll record what I'm doing (before the week is over!) here. I'll try to upload the "artifact" as well - a link to a photo, a git repo, etcetera.
