# 52-weeks
A catalog for once-weekly, outcome oriented activities, starting from 20 June, 2022.

## What & Why

I started this personal, not-tech-specific project as an antidote to "spinning wheels with no traction."

In fact, I think there IS traction, but it's hard to look back and see anything except big progress. Here's an effort to do really small things every week and record them.

## Guidelines

1. Do things that are self enriching.
2. Make it an item that isn't already required by life.
3. Goldilocks time box: try for 3-8 hours total.

#### Examples

This week, I want to...

1. Run 6 miles.
2. Complete a big shelving project.
3. Read a book I've been meaning to get to.
4. Fully complete a small code project.
5. Hike a specific trail.

## Weeks in Review

I'll record what I'm doing (before the week is over!) here. I'll try to upload the "artifact" as well - a link to a photo, a git repo, etcetera.

1. [20 June] Hang a big garage shelf.
2. [27 June] Read the long neglected, very short book: `Keep Going: 10 Ways to Stay Creative in Good Times and Bad`
3. [04 July] Run 3km on two mornings.
